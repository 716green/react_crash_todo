// Followed Brad Traversy's React Crash Course class. Just as he started the react router (npm install react-router-dom) I decided to call it a day. I spent a long time troubleshooting to get UUID to work and I want to learn to better use the router in regular JS before react. Not even sure if React is for me. Need to try a todo list with Vue.
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from './App';


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
